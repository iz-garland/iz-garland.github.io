## About Me
I am a fourth year Astrophysics PhD Student at [Lancaster University](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/physics/about-us/people/isobelle-garland), working with [Dr. Brooke Simmons](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/physics/about-us/people/brooke-simmons) on supermassive black growth and AGN fuelling in the absence of major mergers.

I regularly take part in outreach sessions with [LUniverse Planetarium](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/physics/outreach/planetarium/), bringing the wonder of space to schools and the wider public. We provide a 30 minute immersive tour of the solar system in the planetarium, and run crafts where children can design their own planet. This gets them to think imaginatively about what sort of planet humans could survive on.

## Personal Life
I regularly volunteer with [Girlguiding](https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/), starting as an Assistant Brownie leader in 2016, and becoming a fully qualified leader running my own Brownie unit (girls aged 7-10) in 2018. In 2022 I started up a Guide Unit (girls aged 10-14). Being part of Girlguiding lets me try new challenges and push my limits. In the last 6 years, I have taken girls on many day trips and residentials, volunteered at [Wellies and Wristbands](https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/what-we-do/events-and-opportunities/regular-girlguiding-events/wellies-and-wristbands/) (Girlguiding's flagship festival), organised a sleepover for our entire district in Lancaster Library (72 young members and 17 adults), earned my [camping license](https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/making-guiding-happen/learning-and-development/training-for-travel-and-residentials/going-away-with-scheme/) and started my [Queen's Guide Award](https://www.girlguiding.org.uk/what-we-do/our-badges-and-activities/badge-finder/queens-guide-award/).

I am an avid music fan, and can often be found listening to local bands in Lancaster's pubs with a pint of cider in hand. Lancaster Music Festival is one of my favourite weekends of the year, I love hearing new bands for the first time. I play a handful of instruments myself, including guitar, piano and mandola.

I enjoy baking and cooking, and will be the first to offer to bring cakes to social meet-ups and Great British Bake Off parties (although mine don't look quite as beautiful as some of the things they make).
