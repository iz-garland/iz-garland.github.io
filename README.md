# Izzy LM Garland

I am an Astrophysics PhD Student at [Lancaster University](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/physics/about-us/people/isobelle-garland), working with [Dr. Brooke Simmons](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/physics/about-us/people/brooke-simmons) on supermassive black growth and AGN fuelling in the absence of major mergers.

I regularly take part in outreach sessions with [LUniverse Planetarium](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/physics/outreach/planetarium/), bringing the wonder of space to schools and the wider public.
